AutoLinux is a high-performance Linux provisioning and reinstall tool designed for VPS and bare-metal servers.

It provides a deterministic and automated way to reinstall Debian or Ubuntu systems using official upstream resources, without requiring provider rescue environments.

> This tool is intended for use on systems owned or managed by the operator.

# 📘 Overview

AutoLinux addresses a common infrastructure problem: reliably reprovisioning Linux systems across heterogeneous environments.

Typical use cases include:

• VPS operating system reinstallation  
• migration to modern Debian or Ubuntu releases  
• rebuilding servers without rescue images  
• automated infrastructure recovery  
• rapid reprovisioning workflows  

The tool is designed to be transparent, predictable, and suitable for operators managing their own infrastructure.

# ⚡ Quick Start

> Requires bash (process substitution support).

Run as root on the target system.

You may review the script before execution:

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/linuxtool/main/os/autolinux.sh

---

## Default installation (Debian 12)

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/linuxtool/main/os/autolinux.sh)

---

## Install Debian 13 with custom SSH port and password

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/linuxtool/main/os/autolinux.sh) -d 13 -p "YourPassword" --port 2222

---

## Install Ubuntu 24.04

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/linuxtool/main/os/autolinux.sh) -u 24

---

## Install Ubuntu 22.04

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/linuxtool/main/os/autolinux.sh) -u 22

---

## Full example

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/linuxtool/main/os/autolinux.sh) -u 24 -p "SecurePassword" --port 2222

---

⚠ DATA LOSS WARNING

This tool will completely erase the primary system disk and reinstall the operating system.

All existing data will be permanently destroyed.

Use only on systems you own or are authorized to manage.

# ✨ Key Features

Unified Debian and Ubuntu Installer

AutoLinux supports both Debian and Ubuntu installation workflows through a single interface.

Debian uses the official network installer, while Ubuntu uses official cloud images for faster deployment.

---

BIOS and UEFI Compatibility

Works across both legacy BIOS and modern UEFI systems.

Bootloader configuration is handled automatically.

---

Cross-Distribution Execution

Can be executed from multiple Linux distributions, including:

Debian  
Ubuntu  
CentOS 7  
AlmaLinux  
Rocky Linux  
Fedora  

---

Official Upstream Sources

All installation assets are downloaded from official upstream sources:

• Debian infrastructure  
• Ubuntu cloud image servers  

No modified images or third-party mirrors are used.

---

Deterministic Deployment Model

AutoLinux prioritizes predictable execution:

• simple disk detection  
• explicit network configuration  
• minimal assumptions  

---

High-Speed Ubuntu Deployment

Ubuntu installation uses cloud images:

• download official image  
• modify filesystem offline  
• write directly to disk  

This significantly reduces installation time.

---

Automated SSH Access Setup

AutoLinux configures SSH access during installation to ensure remote accessibility after provisioning.

Authentication parameters are defined explicitly by the operator.

---

Network Optimization

Applies modern TCP settings:

• FQ queue discipline  
• TCP BBR congestion control  

---

IPv6 Handling

IPv6 is restored only if valid parameters are detected from the source system.

Otherwise, deployment falls back to IPv4-only networking.

---

# 📂 Supported Operating Systems

Target Systems:

Debian 13 (Trixie)  
Debian 12 (Bookworm) — Default  
Debian 11 (Bullseye)  

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble) — Default  
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy)  

---

Source Systems:

Debian  
Ubuntu  
CentOS 7  
AlmaLinux  
Rocky Linux  
Fedora  

---

# 🏗 Installation Architecture

Debian Path:

1. download official netboot installer  
2. inject automated configuration  
3. create temporary boot entry  
4. reboot into installer  
5. complete unattended installation  

---

Ubuntu Path:

1. download official cloud image  
2. mount image via qemu-nbd  
3. inject configuration  
4. write image to disk  

---

# 🌐 Network Provisioning Model

AutoLinux uses a deterministic approach:

IPv4 is always configured statically.

IPv6 is restored only when valid parameters exist.

## Example usage

bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/linuxtool/main/os/autolinux.sh) -u 24 -p "SecurePassword" --port 2222

---

# 🔐 Security Model

AutoLinux is designed for controlled environments where the operator has administrative access to the target system.

Important notes:

• no credentials are embedded in the script  
• authentication parameters must be provided explicitly  
• the script operates only on the target system  

---

Post-installation recommendations:

• change credentials immediately  
• configure SSH key authentication  
• disable password authentication if required  
• restrict SSH access using firewall rules  

---

# 🧪 Tested Environments

KVM virtual machines  
cloud VPS providers  
single-disk servers  
BIOS and UEFI systems  
IPv4-only environments  
dual-stack environments  

---

# 📌 Operational Notes

AutoLinux assumes:

• single primary disk  
• one active network interface  
• working IPv4 connectivity  

More complex environments may require manual verification.

---

# 🏆 Design Philosophy

AutoLinux prioritizes:

deterministic behavior  
transparent execution  
broad compatibility  
minimal assumptions  

It avoids:

hidden automation  
environment-specific hacks  
overly complex detection logic
