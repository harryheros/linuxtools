## Overview

OsNova is an automated Linux deployment and reinstallation tool for VPS and bare-metal systems.

It provides a deterministic way to reinstall Debian or Ubuntu directly from the running system using official upstream resources, without requiring a rescue ISO or external recovery environment.

This project is intended for operators who need a fast, reproducible, infrastructure-oriented reinstall workflow.

Use only on systems you own or are explicitly authorized to manage.

---

## Quick Start

Requires Bash and root privileges.

Review before execution:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o reinstall.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/OsNova/main/os/reinstall.sh
less reinstall.sh
```

Default installation (Debian 12):

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/OsNova/main/os/reinstall.sh)
```

Debian 13 with custom password and SSH port:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/OsNova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -d 13 -p "YourPassword" --port 2222
```

Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/OsNova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 24
```

Ubuntu 22.04:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/OsNova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 22
```

Custom DNS example:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/OsNova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 24 --dns "1.1.1.1 9.9.9.9"
```

Full example:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/OsNova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 24 -p "SecurePassword" --port 2222 --dns "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1"
```

## Data Loss Warning

This tool will completely erase the primary disk and reinstall the operating system.

All existing data on the target disk will be permanently destroyed.

Do not run it on any machine unless you fully understand the consequences.

## Supported Operating Systems

Debian:  
- Debian 13 (Trixie)  
- Debian 12 (Bookworm) — default  
- Debian 11 (Bullseye)  

Ubuntu:  
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble) — default  
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy)

## Installation Architecture

Debian path:  
1. Detect current disk and network configuration  
2. Download official Debian netboot installer  
3. Inject preseed configuration and post-install script into initrd  
4. Create a temporary GRUB boot entry  
5. Reboot into the automated Debian installer  

Ubuntu path:  
1. Detect current disk and network configuration  
2. Download official Ubuntu cloud image  
3. Mount the image through qemu-nbd  
4. Configure root password, SSH, sysctl, netplan, cloud-init seed, and DNS  
5. Repair EFI fallback boot path if needed  
6. Write the image directly to the target disk  
7. Reboot into the new system

## Parameters

- d [11|12|13]       Install Debian (default: 12)  
- u [22|24]          Install Ubuntu (default: 24)  
- p password         Set root password  
- port N             Set SSH port (default: 22)  
- dns "IP1 IP2"      Set DNS servers  
- h, help            Show help  

---

## Default Behavior

- If -p is not provided, a random root password is generated automatically  
- The generated password is displayed before reboot and must be saved by the operator  
- SSH is configured to allow root login and password authentication  
- The detected primary disk is used as the installation target  
- Current network settings are reused for static configuration  
- Default DNS servers are 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 unless overridden  
- If --dns is provided, those DNS servers are written into the installed system  

---

## Network Configuration

Debian:  
OsNova installs a static systemd-networkd configuration using the detected IPv4 settings, optional IPv6 settings, and the selected DNS servers.  

Ubuntu:  
OsNova installs a static netplan configuration rendered by systemd-networkd, disables cloud-init network generation, and writes the selected DNS servers into the installed system.  

---

## Tested Environments

- KVM virtual machines  
- Common cloud VPS providers  
- BIOS systems  
- UEFI systems  

---

## Intended Use

OsNova is intended for:  

- VPS reprovisioning  
- Bare-metal operating system replacement  
- Clean system redeployment  
- Infrastructure rebuild workflows  
- Deterministic Debian and Ubuntu reinstall operations  

It is not designed as a rescue panel replacement or a consumer desktop installer.
