## Overview

OsNova is an automated Linux deployment and reinstallation tool for VPS and bare-metal systems.

It provides a deterministic way to reinstall Debian or Ubuntu directly from the running system using official upstream resources, without requiring a rescue ISO or external recovery environment.

OsNova prioritizes deterministic behavior, transparency, and minimal assumptions about the host environment.

This project is intended for operators who need a fast, reproducible, infrastructure-oriented reinstall workflow.

Use only on systems you own or are explicitly authorized to manage.

## Quick Start

Requires Bash, root privileges, and an x86_64 system.

Review before execution:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o reinstall.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/osnova/main/os/reinstall.sh
less reinstall.sh
```

Default installation (Debian 12):

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/osnova/main/os/reinstall.sh)
```

Debian 13 with custom password and SSH port:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/osnova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -d 13 -p "YourPassword" --port 2222
```

Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/osnova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 24
```

Ubuntu 22.04:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/osnova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 22
```

Custom DNS example:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/osnova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 24 --dns "1.1.1.1 9.9.9.9"
```

Skip confirmation prompt (for automation):

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/osnova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 24 -p "SecurePassword" --port 2222 --force
```

Full example:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryheros/osnova/main/os/reinstall.sh) -u 24 -p "SecurePassword" --port 2222 --dns "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1" --force
```

## Data Loss Warning

> ⚠️ This tool will completely erase the primary disk and reinstall the operating system.
>
> All existing data on the target disk will be permanently destroyed.
>
> Do not run it unless you fully understand the consequences.
>
> Starting from v2.0.0, OsNova requires explicit confirmation before proceeding. Use `--force` to skip this prompt in automated workflows.

## Supported Operating Systems

Debian:  
- Debian 13 (Trixie)  
- Debian 12 (Bookworm) — default  
- Debian 11 (Bullseye)  

Ubuntu:  
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble) — default  
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy)  

---

## Installation Architecture

Debian path:  
1. Pre-check root privilege and x86_64 architecture  
2. Detect current disk and network configuration  
3. Confirm with operator before proceeding  
4. Download official Debian netboot installer  
5. Inject preseed configuration and post-install script into initrd  
6. Create a temporary GRUB boot entry  
7. Reboot into the automated Debian installer  

Ubuntu path:  
1. Pre-check root privilege and x86_64 architecture  
2. Detect current disk and network configuration  
3. Confirm with operator before proceeding  
4. Download official Ubuntu cloud image and verify integrity  
5. Mount the image through qemu-nbd  
6. Configure root password, SSH, sysctl, netplan, cloud-init seed, and DNS  
7. Repair EFI fallback boot path if needed  
8. Write the image directly to the target disk  
9. Reboot into the new system

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `-d [11\|12\|13]` | Install Debian (default: 12) |
| `-u [22\|24]` | Install Ubuntu (default: 24) |
| `-p PASSWORD` | Set root password |
| `-port PORT`, `--port PORT` | Set SSH port (default: 22) |
| `--dns "IP1 IP2"` | Set DNS servers (default: 8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1) |
| `-f`, `--force` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `-v`, `--version` | Show version info |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |

---

## Password Rules

If `-p` is not provided, a 20-character random password is generated automatically.

Allowed characters: `A-Z a-z 0-9 ! @ # % ^ * _ + = . -`

Characters that could interfere with shell expansion or preseed parsing are rejected:  
`` $ ` " ' \ spaces ( ) { } | & ; < > ~ ``

---

## Default Behavior

- A confirmation prompt is displayed before any destructive action (skip with `--force`)  
- If -p is not provided, a random root password is generated automatically  
- The generated password is displayed before reboot and must be saved by the operator  
- SSH is configured to allow root login and password authentication  
- The detected primary disk is used as the installation target  
- Current network settings are reused for static configuration  
- Default DNS servers are 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 unless overridden  
- If --dns is provided, those DNS servers are written into the installed system  

---

## Network Configuration

Debian:  
OsNova installs a static systemd-networkd configuration using the detected IPv4 settings, optional IPv6 settings, and the selected DNS servers. IPv4 /32 and IPv6 /128 prefixes are handled with GatewayOnLink routing.

Ubuntu:  
OsNova installs a static netplan configuration rendered by systemd-networkd, disables cloud-init network generation, and writes the selected DNS servers into the installed system. IPv4 /32 and IPv6 /128 prefixes are handled with on-link routing.

---

## Tested Environments

- KVM virtual machines  
- Common cloud VPS providers  
- BIOS systems  
- UEFI systems  

---

## Intended Use

OsNova is intended for:  

- VPS reprovisioning  
- Bare-metal operating system replacement  
- Clean system redeployment  
- Infrastructure rebuild workflows  
- Deterministic Debian and Ubuntu reinstall operations  

It is not designed as a rescue panel replacement or a consumer desktop installer.
